	;Helper method for GenerateCase that enforces new case generation by testing whether the generated case is unique enough,
	;and will attempt to generate a new case up to 2 times if generated cases are too similar to an existing one in the model.
	;Uniqueness test is: given a generated case, find its closest neighbor case, compare all feature values and verify that at
	;least floor(1 + log(num_features)) features have deltas larger than their respective feature residuals and the distance to
	;the closest case is larger than the minimum case distance contribution among all neighbors in the generated case's local space.
	;Outputs the generated case if it's unique enough, otherwise outputs null.
