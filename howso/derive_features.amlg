;Contains methods to derive features or feature values as defined by feature attributes.
(null

	;Derived during train features should have a feature attribute of 'auto_derive_on_train', an asoc defining how to derive the feature with the
	; following attributes:
	;
	;	derive_type: string attribute defining the type of derivation, one of 'custom', 'start', 'end'.  Each derive_type has its own attribute set.
	;
	;		'derive_type' : "custom" -
	;			This feature is derived using the specified 'code'. For each series, where each series is defined by "series_id_features",
	;			the rows are processed in order, after being sorted by "ordered_by_features". If series is not specified, processes the entire
	;			dataset. Referencing data in rows uses 0-based indexing, where the current row index is 0, the previous row's is 1, etc.
	;			Specified code may do simple logic and numeric operations on feature values referenced via feature name and row offset.
	;			Examples:
	;				"#x 1" - Use the value for feature 'x' from the previously processed row (offset of 1, one lag value).
	;				"(- #y 0 #x 1)" - Feature 'y' value from current (offset 0) row  minus feature 'x' value from previous (offest 1) row.
	;		'code': string, Code describing how feature could be derived. Example: "(- #y 0 #x 1)"
	;		'series_id_features' : (optional) list of feature name(s) of series for which to derive this feature. A series is the conjunction of all
	;			the features specified by this attribute.
	;		'ordered_by_features' : (optional) list of fature name(s) by which to order the series specified by "series_id_features". Series values
	;			are order by the order of feature names specified by this attribute.
	;
	;
	;		'derive_type' : "progress" -
	;			This will create two continuous features of: .series_progress with values ranging from 0 to 1.0 for each case in the series
	;			and '.series_progress_delta' which is the delta value of the progress for each case. Used to determine when to stop series synth.
	;
	;		'series_id_features' : list of feature name(s) of series for which to derive this feature. A series is the conjunction of all
	;			the features specified by this attribute.
	;

	;At the end of train, derive features using the existing model, provided a list of features to derive. Creates and populates the specified
	;features to the model.
	;
	;parameters:
	; features: list of features the dataset was trained with originally
	; derived_features: list of features to derive, in the specified order.
	; case_ids: list of case ids for which to derive features
