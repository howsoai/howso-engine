	;		"num_trained" num_trained_cases
	;		"ablated_indices" (list of session training indices for the ablated cases)
	;		"status" "status output message"
	;	)
	; 	list of 'status' values:
	;		(null) - default output, no status output
	;		"analyzed" - if auto analysis is enabled and model has grown large enough to be analyzed again and was analyzed
	;		"analyze" - if auto analysis is enabled and model has grown large enough to be analyzed again but was not analyzed
	;
	; parameters:
	; cases : list of cases, ie a list of lists of values.
	; features : the list of features.
	; derived_features: optional list of features to derive in the specified order. If this list is not provided, features with
	;	   the 'auto_derive_on_train' feature attribute set to True will be auto-derived. If provided an empty list, will not derive any features.
	;	   Any derived_features that are already in the 'features' list will not be derived since their values are being explicitly provided.
	; session: the session label to record these cases to.  If not specified, refers to this entity's label of same name.
	; input_is_substituted : flag, if set to true assumes provided categorical (nominal or ordinal) feature values already been substituted.
	; series: optional, name of series to pull features and case values from internal series storage.  If specified, trains on all cases that are
	;		stored in the internal series store for the specified series and session. The trained feature set is the combined features from storage
	;		and the passed in features.  If cases is of length one, the value(s) of this case are appended to all cases in the series.
	;		If cases is the same length as the series, the value of each case in cases is applied in order to each of the cases in the
	;		series.
	; accumulate_weight_feature: name of feature into which to accumulate neighbors' influences as weight for ablated cases. If unspecified, will not accumulate weights.
	; train_weights_only: flag, if set to true, and accumulate_weight_feature is provided, will not train on the cases, but instead accumulate all of their neighbor weights.
	; skip_auto_analyze: flag, if set to true, will not auto_analyze, but will instead return the status "analyze" which indicates that an analyze call is recommended
