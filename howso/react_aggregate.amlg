    ;Computes, caches, and returns specified details and feature prediction statistics such as Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA), residuals (accuracy, Mean Absolute Error),
    ; precision, recall, etc. Returns details and feature prediction stats for all features in the format of feature -> assoc stat -> value
    ;
    ;parameters:
    ; context_features: optional list of features to use as contexts for computations. default is all features if unspecified.
    ; num_samples: optional. Total sample size of model to use (using sampling with replacement) for all non-robust computation.
    ;               Defaults to 1000. If specified overrides sample_model_fraction.
    ; num_robust_residual_samples: optional. Total sample size of model to use (using sampling with replacement) for robust feature_mda and residual computation.
    ;               Defaults to 1000 * (1 + log(number of features)).  Note: robust feature_mda will be updated to use num_robust_influence_samples in a future release.
    ; num_robust_influence_samples: optional. Total sample size of model to use (using sampling with replacement) for robust contribution computation.
    ;               Defaults to 300.
    ; num_robust_influence_samples_per_case: optional, Specifies the number of robust samples to use for each case for robust contribution computations.
    ;               Defaults to 300 + 2 * (number of features).
    ; robust_hyperparameters: flag, optional. if specified, will attempt to return stats that were computed using hyperpparameters with the
    ;               specified robust or non-robust type.
    ; sample_model_fraction : optional, value 0.0 - 1.0, percent of model to use in sampling (using sampling without replacement).
    ;               Applicable only to non-robust computation. Ignored if num_samples is specified.
    ; sub_model_size: optional. if specified will calculate only on a sub model of the specified size from the full model.
    ;               Applicable only to models > 1000 cases.
    ; hyperparameter_param_path: optional. full path for hyperparameters to use for computation.
    ;               If specified for any residual computations, takes precendence over action_feature parameter.
    ; use_case_weights: optional, flag, if set to true will scale influence weights by each case's weight_feature weight. If unspecified,
	;   			case weights will be used if the trainee has them.
    ; weight_feature: optional, default '.case_weight'.  name of feature whose values to use as case weights
    ;               "generate_attempts" true or false. If true, outputs the total number of attempts to generate the unique case. Only applicable for generative
    ;               reacts where generate_new_cases is "always" or "attempt". When used with ReactSeries, "series_generate_attempts" is also returned.
    ; action_feature: optional, target feature for which to do computations. If "prediction_stats_action_feature" and "feature_influences_action_feature"
	;				are not provided, they will default to this value.
	; prediction_stats_action_feature: optional. When calculating residuals and prediction stats, uses this target features's hyperparameters. The trainee must
	;				have been analyzed with this feature as the action feature first. If both "prediction_stats_action_feature" and "action_feature" are not provided,
	;				by default residuals and prediction stats uses ".targetless" hyperparameters. If "action_feature" is provided, and this value is not provided, will
	;				default to the value of "action_feature".
	; feature_influences_action_feature: optional, When feature influences such as contributions and mda, use this feature as the action feature.
	;				If not provided, will default to the "action_feature" if provided.
	; confusion_matrix_min_count: number, optional, default is 10. Applicable only to confusion matrices when computing residuals, the number of predictions
	;				a class should have (value of a cell in the matrix) for it to remain in the confusion matrix. If the count is less than this value, it will
	;				be accumulated into a single value of all insignificant predictions for the class and removed from the confusion matrix.
    ; details: assoc, optional. an assoc of flags for which type of audit data to return, and corresponding values to return (if applicable) in the format of:
    ;   (assoc
    ;		prediction_stats: optional true/false. If true outputs full feature prediction stats for all (context and action)
    ;				features. The prediction stats returned are set by the "selected_prediction_stats" parameter. Uses full calculations, which
    ;				uses leave-one-out for features for computations. false removes cached values. Uses full computation.
    ;		feature_residuals_full: optional, none/true/false. For each context_feature, use the full set of all other context_features to
    ;               predict the feature.  When true, computes, caches, and returns the residuals for all features. Uses full computation.
    ;               false removes cached values. When "prediction_stats" in the "details" parameter is true, it will also compute and cache the feature residuals.
	;		feature_residuals_robust: optional, none/true/false. For each context_feature, computes, caches, and returns the same stats as residuals but using the robust
    ;               (power set/permutations) set of all other context_features to predict the feature. false removes cached values. Uses robust computation.
    ;		feature_contributions_full: optional, none/true/false. For each context_feature, use the full set of all other context_features to compute the
    ;				mean absolute delta between prediction of action_feature with and without the context_feature in the model. false removes cached values. Uses full computation.
    ;		feature_contributions_robust: optional, none/true/false. For each context_feature, use the robust (power set/permutation) set of all other context_features
    ;				to compute the mean absolute delta between prediction of action_feature with and without the context_feature in the model. Uses robust computation.
    ;				false removes cached values. Uses robust computation.

    ;				Drop each feature and use the full set of remaining context features for each prediction. false removes cached values. Uses full computation.
    ;		feature_mda_permutation_full: optional, none/true/false. Compute feature_mda_full by scrambling each feature and using the full set of remaining context features
    ;				for each prediction.  false removes cached values. Uses full computation.
    ;		feature_mda_robust: optional, none/true/false. Compute feature_mda by dropping each feature and using the robust (power set/permutations) set of
    ;				remaining context features for each prediction. false removes cached values. Uses robust computation.
    ;		feature_mda_permutation_robust: optional, none/true/false. Compute feature_mda by scrambling each feature and using the robust (power set/permutations)
    ;				set of remaining context features for each prediction.  false removes cached values. Uses robust computation.

    ;						"mda" : mean decrease in accuracy when each feature is dropped from the model, applies to all features.
    ;						"contribution": feature contribution to predicted value when each feature is dropped from the model, applies to all features.
    ;						"mda_permutation": mean decrease in accuracy that used scrambling of feature values instead of dropping each feature, applies to all features.
    ;						"mae" : Mean absolute error. For continuous features, this is calculated as the mean of absolute values of the difference
    ;							between the actual and predicted values. For nominal features, this is 1 - the average categorical action probability of each case's
    ;							correct classes. Categorical action probabilities are the probabilities for each class for the action feature.
    ;						"r2": r-squared coefficient of determination, for continuous features only.
    ;						"rmse": root mean squared error, for continuous features only.
    ;						"spearman_coeff": Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, for continuous features only.
    ;						"precision": precision (positive predictive) value for nominal features only. Aggregated by taking the unweighted means of each classes' precisions.
    ;						"recall": recall (sensitivity) value for nominal features only. Aggregated by taking the unweighted means of each classes' recalls.
    ;						"accuracy": The number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.
    ;						"confusion_matrix": A matrix showing the number of predicted values of each class
    ;							for each unique value of the predicted feature. Outputs the sparse confusion matrix.
