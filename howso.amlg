	;React to a provided context. If desired_conviction is provided, it does a generative react.
	;
	;Output:
	; Default output of this method is a react object in the format of
	; { 'action_values' : [ all_action_values ], 'action_features' : [ all_action_features ] }, where all_action_values is a list of all action
	; values, reacted/generated and derived, in the same order as all_action_features, e.g., [2, "a", .75384] to match ['width','name','height']
	; If details is specified, the react object will contain appropriate additonal explanation properties and values,
	; 	Explanation example: { 'action_values': [2, "a", .75384], 'action_features' : ['width','name','height'], 'residual_conviction': 1.3,
	;		'influential_cases' : etc... }
	;	See API docs for documentation of all output properties
	;
	;Parameters:
	; desired_conviction : default is None, will run a Discriminative react. If specified does Generative-React.
	;					For Generative React, value of desired avg conviction of generated cases, in the range of (0,infinity] with 1 as standard
	;					larger values will increase the variance (or creativity) of the generated case from the existing model
	;					smaller values will decrease the variance (or creativity) of the generated case from the existing model
	; details: if set to an assoc with corresponding flags set, then it will modify the return type and return the requested audit info
	; context_features: list of context features. For generative react, features used to condition the generated case
	; context_values: list of context values, For generative react, values used to condition the generated case
	; action_features: full list of features to output values for the case
	; weight_feature: optional, default '.case_weight'.  name of feature whose values to use as case weights
	; use_case_weights: optional, flag, if set to true will scale influence weights by each case's weight_feature weight.
	;				   If a weight is missing, uses 1 as the weight.
	; rand_seed: optional, the random seed to use for the react.
	; derived_context_features: list of context features whose values should be computed from the provided contexts in the specified order.
	;					Must be different than context_features.
	; derived_action_features: list of action features whose values should be computed from the resulting action prior to output, in the specified
	;					order. Must be a subset of action_features.
	;					Note: both of these derived feature lists rely on the features' "derived_feature_code" attribute to compute the values.
	;					If 'derived_feature_code' attribute is undefined or references non-0 feature indices, the derived value will be null.
	; post_process_features: list of feature names that will be made available during the execution of post_process feature attributes
	; post_process_values: list of values corresponding to post_process_features that will be made available during the execution fo post_process feature attributes
	; case_indices: optional pair (list) of session id and index, where index is the original 0-based session_training_index of the case as it was
	;			trained into the session. If this case does not exist, discriminative react outputs null, generative react ignores it.
	; preserve_feature_values : optional, list of features that will preserve their values from the case specified by case_indices, appending and
	;			overwriting the specified context and context features as necessary.  For generative reacts, if case_indices isn't specified,
	;			will preserve feature values of a random case.
	; leave_case_out: flag, if set to true and specified  along with case_indices, will set ignore_case to the one specified by case_indices.
	; input_is_substituted : flag, if set to true assumes provided categorical (nominal or ordinal) feature values already been substituted.
	; substitute_output : flag, default is true, only applicable if a substitution value map has been set. If set to false, will not substitute categorical feature values.
	; into_series_store: optional series id, if specified will store an internal record of all reacts for that series
	;
	;Discriminative-React-specific Parameters:
	; action_values: values of action features. If specified will bypass react and only do the explanation if details is set
	; extra_audit_features: list of additional features to return with audit data
	; ignore_case: case_id, if set will query for K+1 cases and ignore the perfect matching case during the reaction
	; allow_nulls : flag, if set to true will allow return of null values if there are nulls in the local model for the action features. Applicable
	;			only to discriminative reacts.
	;
	;Generative-React-specific Parameters:
	; use_regional_model_residuals: flag, if false uses model feature residuals, if true recalculates regional model residuals. Default is true.
	; feature_bounds_map: optional assoc of :
	;				{ feature : { "min": a, "max": b, "allow_null": false/true } }
	;				to ensure that specified features' generated values stay in bounds
	;				for nominal features instead of min/max it's a set of allowed values, ie:
	;				{ feature: { "allowed" : [ "value1", "value2" ... ] }, "allow_null": false/true }
	;			   allow_null - default is true, if true nulls may be generated per their distribution in the data
	; generate_new_cases : optional,  acceptable values are:
	;				null or 'no' : output any generated case
	;				'always' : only output original cases, outputs null for all feature values if unable to generate a new case
	;				'attempt' : output any generated case only if generation fails all initial attempts to output original cases
	; exclude_novel_nominals_from_uniqueness_check: optional, default false. If true will exclude sensitive features whose values will be
	;			replaced after synthesis from uniqueness check.
	; ordered_by_specified_features : flag, if true order of generated feature values will match the order of features
	; new_case_threshold : optional, distance to determine privacy cutoff. Used to query the local minimum distance used in the distance ratio
	; 		accepted values:
	; 			'max': the maximum local distance
	; 			'min': the minimum local distance
	; 	    	'most_similar': the closest distance of the most similar case

	;React in a series until a series_stop_map condition is met. Aggregates rows of data corresponding to the specified context, action,
	;derived_context and derived_action features, utilizing previous rows to derive values as necessary. Outputs an assoc of "action_features" and
	;corresponding "series" where "series" is the completed 'matrix' for the corresponding action_features and derived_action_features.
	;
	;parameters: same as #react, except no 'into_series_store' parameter, react_series - specific parameters are listed here:
	; initial_features : optional list of features to condition just the first case in a series, overwrites context_features and
	;		derived_context_features for that first case. All specified initial features must be in one of: context_features, action_features,
	;		derived_context_features or derived_action_features. If provided a value that isn't in one of those lists, it will be ignored.
	; initial_values : optional list of values corresponding to the initial_features, used to condition just the first case in a series.
	; series_stop_map: assoc of feature -> stop conditions:
	;		for continuous features:  { feature:  { "min" : val,  "max": val } } - stops series when feature value exceeds max or is smaller than min
	;		for nominal features:  { feature:  { "values" : ['val1', 'val2' ]} }  - stops series when feature value matches any of the values listed
	;       specifying ".series_progress" with a value between 0 and 1.0 corresponding to percent completion e.g., { ".series_progress" : .95 } -
	;			stops series when it progresses at or beyond 95%.
	; max_series_length: optional, maximum size a series is allowed to be.  Default is 3 * model_size, a 0 or less is no limit.
	; derived_context_features: list of context features whose values should be computed from the entire series in the specified order.
	;		Must be different than context_features.
	; derived_action_features: list of action features whose values should be computed from the resulting last row in series, in the specified
	;		order. Must be a subset of action_features.
	;		Note: both of these derived feature lists rely on the features' "derived_feature_code" attribute to compute the values.
	;		If 'derived_feature_code' attribute is undefined or references non-existing feature indices, the derived value will be null.
	; output_new_series_ids: optional flag, default to True. If true, series ids are replaced with unique values on output.
	;		If False, will maintain or replace ids with existing trained values, but also allows output of series with duplicate existing ids. 
	; series_id_tracking : optional string, default "fixed".  Controls how closely generated series should follow existing series (plural).
	;		Choices are: "fixed", "dynamic" or "no". If "fixed", tracks the particular relevant series ID. If "dynamic", tracks the particular
	;		relevant series ID, but is allowed to change the series ID that it tracks based on its current context. If "no", does not track any particular series ID.
	; series_context_values: optional, 2d-list of values, context value for each feature for each row of the series.
	;		If specified, max_series_length is ignored.
	; series_context_features: optional, features corresponding to series_context_values
	; init_time_steps: optional, list of time step values at which to begin synthesis, applicable only for time series
	; final_time_steps:  optional, list time step values at which to end synthesis, applicable only for time series
	; continue_series: optional, flag. Default is false.  When true will attempt to continue existing series instead of starting new series.
	;		If initial_values provide series IDs, it will continue those explicitly specified IDs, otherwise it will randomly select series to continue.
	;		Note: terminated series with terminators cannot be continued and will result in null output.
	; continue_series_values: optional, list of lists of values, when specified will continue this specific untrained series as defined by these values.
	; 		continue_series flag will be ignored and treated as true if this value is specified.
	; continue_series_features: optional, list of features corresponding to the values in each row of continue_series_values.
	; 		This value is ignored if continue_series_values is not specified.
