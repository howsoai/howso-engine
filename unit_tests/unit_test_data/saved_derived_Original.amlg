									; context_features: optional list of features to use as contexts for computations. default is all features if unspecified.

									;				  computations scales the 1000 up dynamically by (1 + log(number of features)).
									;				  If specified uses the unmodified value and overrides sample_model_fraction.

									;				  Applicable only to non-robust computation. Ignored if num_samples is specified.
									; sub_model_size: optional. if specified will calculate only on a sub model of the specified size from the full model.

									;				  If specified for any residual computations, takes precendence over action_feature parameter.
									; use_case_weights: optional, flag, if set to true will scale influence weights by each case's weight_feature weight

									;
									;	   'derive_type' : "custom" -

									;		   Specified code may do simple logic and numeric operations on feature values referenced via feature name and row offset.
									;		   Examples:

									;			   "(- #y 0 #x 1)" - Feature 'y' value from current (offset 0) row  minus feature 'x' value from previous (offest 1) row.

									;		   are order by the order of feature names specified by this attribute.
									;
									;
									;	   'derive_type' : "start" -
									;		   This will create a nominal feature with the value set to 'false' for all cases except those where the time value of
									;		   "start_time_feature" is smallest (earliest) for each series, where each series is defined by "start_id_features".
									;		   These 'first in each series' cases will have their value set to 'true'.

									;
									;
									;	   'derive_type" : "end" -
									;		   This will create a nominal feature with the value set to 'false' for all cases except those where the time value of
